 * Whether the Navidrome id re-key still has to run, and how far it got.
 *
 * A STANDING check, not a one-shot tied to a release. Users upgrade their server on their
 * own schedule — someone deliberately holding Navidrome at 0.63 for a year still needs
 * this the day they upgrade — so the condition is evaluated on every launch and this
 * module stays in the app indefinitely. No transition tracking is needed: the condition
 * simply becomes true once their server crosses 0.64.0.
 *
 * Reads and writes go through `kvStorageSync`, because the gate is consulted on the boot
 * path and by the headless media service, neither of which can await a hydration.
 *
 * One install points at one server: editing the server URL reaches the same server at a
 * different address, and switching servers means logging out, which clears the marker
 * along with the data. So a single marker describes the situation exactly.
