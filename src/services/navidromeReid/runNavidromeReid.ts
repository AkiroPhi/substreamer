 *   1. the FK-deferral self-check, before anything is written
 *   2. the live queue, cleared so a queue of retired ids is never restored
 *   3. the id map

 *   5. the files, which cannot be rolled back and so go last among the writes
 *   6. the stores, which still hold old ids in memory until they are rehydrated
 *   7. the marker, only once every step above has succeeded
 *
 * The marker is the only thing that stops this running again, and it is stamped last on
 * purpose: an interrupted run re-enters the interstitial on the next launch and repeats
 * from the top. Every step is idempotent, so repeating is free.
